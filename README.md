# Secure File Shredder #
This is a file shredding utility. File shredding can help in protecting your sensitive data from being recovered after deletion. 
Generally speaking when a file is deleted from a system, the bits and bytes of data are not cleared by the OS. The OS just notes it down in it's file system manager
that certain bytes on the disk don't belong to any file. 
It is still possible to assemble stuff out of the "orphaned" data. 
Our tiny little utility will help you overwrite the bytes of your data up to three times. Our 3x shredding approach will make your data impossible to recover.
